(** Time zone management.

  You can [change] the [current] time zone in your program by side effect. *)

(** Type of a time zone. *)
type t = 
  | UTC             (** Greenwich Meridian Time              *)
  | Local           (** Local Time                           *)
  | UTC_Plus of int (** Another time zone specified from UTC *)

val current : unit -> t
  (** Return the current time zone. It is [UTC] before any change. *)

val change : t -> unit
  (** Change the current time zone by another one. 
      Raise [Invalid_argument] if the specified time zone is [UTC_Plus x] with
      x < -12 or x > 11 *)
  
val gap : t -> t -> int
  (** Return the gap between two time zone. 
      E.g. [gap UTC (UTC_Plus 5)] returns 5 and, at Paris in summer,
      [gap Local UTC] returns -2. *)

val from_gmt : unit  -> int
  (** [from_gmt ()] is equivalent to [gap UTC (current ())]. *)

val to_gmt : unit -> int
  (** [to_gmt ()] is equivalent to [gap (current ()) UTC]. *)

val is_dst : unit -> bool
  (** [is_dst ()] checks if daylight saving time is in effect.
      Only relevant in local time.
      Returns alway [false] in another time zone. *)

val hour_of_dst : unit -> int
  (** [hour_of_dst ()] returns [1] if [is_dst ()] and [0] otherwise. *)
