(** Date operations.

  This module implements operations on dates. 
  A date is a triple (year, month, day). 
  
  All the dates should belong to 
  [[January, 1st 4713 BC; January 22th, 3268 AC]] (called the Julian period).
  An [Out_of_bounds] exception is raised if you attempt to create a date 
  outside the Julian period.

  If a date [d] does not exists and if [d_bef] (resp. [d_aft]) is 
  the last (resp. first) existing date before (resp. after) [d], 
  [d] is automatically coerced to [d_aft + d - d_bef - 1].
  For example, both dates "February 29th, 2003" and 
  "February 30th, 2003" do not exist and they are coerced respectively to the 
  date "Mars 1st, 2003" and "Mars 2nd, 2003". 
  This rule is called the coercion rule.
  As an exception to the coercion rule, the date belonging to 
  [[October 5th, 1582; October 14th, 1582]] do not exist and an [Undefined] 
  exception is raised if you attempt to create such a date.
  Those dropped days correspond to the change from the Julian to the Gregorian
  calendar. *)

  (** Number of days in a year. 

    [days_in_year ~month y] returns the number of days in the year [y] up to

    [days_in_year y]. *)

val indiction : year -> int
  (** Indiction. 
   
    The Indiction was used in the middle ages to specify the position of a 
    year in a 15 year taxation cycle. It was introduced by emperor Constantine 
    the Great on 1 September 312 and ceased to be used in 1806. 

    The Indiction has no astronomical significance. *)

val golden_number : year -> int
  (** Golden number. 

    Considering that the relationship between the moon's phases and the days 
    of the year repeats itself every 19 years, it is natural to associate a 
    number between 1 and 19 with each year. 
    This number is the so-called Golden number. *)
