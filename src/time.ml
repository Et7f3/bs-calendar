(*S Introduction.

  A time is represents by a number of seconds in UTC.
  Outside this module, a time is interpreted in the current time zone.
  So, each operations have to coerce a given time according to the current
  time zone. *)

(*S Datatypes. *)

type t = int

type field = [ `Hour | `Minute | `Second ]

(*S Conversions. *)

let one_day = 86400

let convert t t1 t2 = t + 3600 * Time_Zone.gap t1 t2

let from_gmt t = convert t Time_Zone.UTC (Time_Zone.current ())

let to_gmt t = convert t (Time_Zone.current ()) Time_Zone.UTC

(* Coerce [t] into the interval $[0; 86400[$ (i.e. a one day interval). *)
let normalize t = 
  let t = from_gmt t in
  let t_mod, t_div = to_gmt (t mod one_day), t / one_day in
  if t < 0 then t_mod + one_day, t_div - 1 else t_mod, t_div

(*S Constructors. *)

let now () =
  let now = Unix.gmtime (Unix.time ()) in
  3600 * now.Unix.tm_hour + 60 * now.Unix.tm_min + now.Unix.tm_sec

(*S Getters. *)

let hour t = from_gmt t / 3600

let minute t = from_gmt t mod 3600 / 60

let second t = from_gmt t mod 60

let to_hours t = float_of_int (from_gmt t) /. 3600.

(*S Boolean operations. *)

let compare = compare

let equal = (==)

let is_pm t = let t, _ = normalize t in t < midday ()

let is_am t = let t, _ = normalize t in t >= midday ()

(*S Coercions. *)

let from_hours t = to_gmt (int_of_float (t *. 3600.))

let from_minutes t = to_gmt (int_of_float (t *. 60.))

let from_seconds t = to_gmt t

(*S Period. *)
