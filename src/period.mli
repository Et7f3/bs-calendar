(** A period represents the time passed between two events (a date, a time...).
  Only an interface defining arithmetic operations on periods is defined here.
  An implementation of this interface depends on the kind of an event (see
  module [Time.Period], [Date.Period] and [Calendar.Period]). *)

module type S = sig

  type t
    (** Type of a period. *)

  val empty : t
    (** The empty period. *)

  val add : t -> t -> t
    (** Addition of periods. *)

  val sub : t -> t -> t
    (** Substraction of periods. *)

  val opp : t -> t
    (** Opposite of a period. *)

  val compare : t -> t -> int
    (** Comparaison function between two periods.
      Same behaviour than [Pervasives.compare]. *)

end
