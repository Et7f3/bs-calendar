This program is distributed under the GNU LGPL. 
See the enclosed file COPYING for more details.

4- Installation
---------------

You need Objective Caml >= 3.06 to compile the sources.
You need too ocamlfind coming with findlib and available at:
	http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

	1. Configure with ./configure.
	2. Compile with make.
	3. Install with make install (you may need superuser permissions).
	4. Clean the directory with make clean.

You can remove files installed by "make install" at any time with :

	make uninstall (you may need superuser permissions)

5- How to use
-------------

(a) Simply link calendar with your files using ocamlfind.

For example, if you have a file foo_using_calendar.ml, compile it as follow:

	ocamlfind ocamlc -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlfind ocamlopt -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml

(b) Alternatively, do not use ocamlfind, link calendar with unix and str and
specify the directory containing calendar:

	ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cma str.cma calendar.cma foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlopt -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cmxa str.cmxa calendar.cmxa foo_using_calendar.ml

6- Documentation
----------------

The definitions provided by this library are fully commented in the
.mli files. The html directory contains an html version of those .mli files.

The file calendar.ps.gz is a more user friendly documentation.

7- Makefile
-----------

A description of some Makefile entries follows :

i. tests
Execute some tests

ii. wc 
Give informations about the size of the source files. You need ocamlwc (*). 

iii. calendar.ps
Produce the source file documentation. You need ocamlweb (**).

iv. calendar.ps.gz
Same as above. Moreover the documentation is zipped.

v. mli2html
Produce the html files in the html directory. You need caml2html (***).

(*)   ocamlwc is available at http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html
(**)  ocamlweb is available at http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ocamlweb
(***) caml2html is available at http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.ailleret/caml
