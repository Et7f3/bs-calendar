See the enclosed file COPYING for more details.

4- Installation
---------------

You need Objective Caml >= 3.06 to compile the sources.
You need too ocamlfind coming with findlib and available at:
	http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

	1. Configure with ./configure.
	2. Compile with make.
	3. Install with make install (you may need superuser permissions).
	4. Clean the directory with make clean.

You can remove files installed by "make install" at any time with :

	make uninstall (you may need superuser permissions)

5- How to use
-------------

(a) Use the GODI package of calendar !

	see: http://godi.ocaml-programming.de

(b) Or: simply link calendar with your files using ocamlfind.

For example, if you have a file foo_using_calendar.ml, compile it as follow:

	ocamlfind ocamlc -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlfind ocamlopt -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml

(c) Or: do not use ocamlfind, link calendar with unix and str and
specify the directory containing calendar:

	ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cma calendar.cma foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlopt -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cmxa calendar.cmxa foo_using_calendar.ml

6- Documentation
----------------

The doc directory contains an html documentation of the .mli files.
This documentation is available online at 

	http://www.lri.fr/~signoles/prog/calendar/doc

The file calendar.ps.gz is the source code documentation.

7- Makefile
-----------

A description of some Makefile entries follows :

i. tests
Execute some tests

ii. wc 
Give informations about the size of the source files. You need ocamlwc (*). 

iii. calendar.ps
Produce the source file documentation. You need ocamlweb (**).

iv. calendar.ps.gz
Same as above. Moreover the documentation is zipped.

v. doc
Produce the documentation of the API. You need ocamldoc (***).

(*)   ocamlwc is available at http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html
(**)  ocamlweb is available at http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ocamlweb
(***) ocamldoc is included with Objective Caml
