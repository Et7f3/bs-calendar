4- Installation
---------------

You need Objective Caml >= 3.09.1 to compile the sources.
You need too ocamlfind coming with findlib and available at:
	http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

	1. Configure with ./configure.
	2. Compile with make.
	3. Install with make install (you may need superuser permissions).
	4. Clean the directory with make clean.

You can remove files installed by "make install" at any time with :

(b) Or: simply link calendar with your files using ocamlfind.

For example, if you have a file foo_using_calendar.ml, compile it as follow:

	ocamlfind ocamlc -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlfind ocamlopt -package calendar -linkpkg foo_using_calendar.ml

(c) Or: do not use ocamlfind, link calendar with unix and str and
specify the directory containing calendar:

	ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cma calendarLib.cmo foo_using_calendar.ml
or
	ocamlopt -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/calendar unix.cmxa calendarLib.cmx foo_using_calendar.ml

A description of some Makefile entries follows :

i. tests
Execute some tests

ii. wc 
Give informations about the size of the source files. You need ocamlwc (*). 

iii. doc
